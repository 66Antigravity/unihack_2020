# Webapp for automatic grading

A lot of techers, expecially the university teaches, have problem with grading after the test. They bunch of papers and after they grade them, their work doesn't finish. Then then need to assign grades and points to students in to the school system. Sometimes they even have to send the evaluated tests directly to students. 

However most of the school information systems provide and API for exporting or importing the grades in .csv files. Every student also have his/her own personal id number, which belons to him during the whole stay at university. These two were the main reasons why we decided to develop a solution for automizing the step in between the teach and the school system.
